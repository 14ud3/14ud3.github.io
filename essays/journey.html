  <p>What I’ve learned in Web Development so far…</p>

<p>I have been involved in the security field for a very long time, and while focused on this field, I didn’t spend any of my time on actual web application projects. Except knowing that niche programmers have been using this particular skill to earn money, I also figured that it would be a good time to get into it and try out stuff that I haven’t done before.</p>

<p>Now honestly, I’m not really a beginner when it comes to this topic, I’ve pretty much gathered some basic knowledge with some of the technologies used in web development like Javascript and HTML since I was on the ninth grade, simply because being able to read a scripting language like Javascript is an important skill when you’re looking for common web application bugs like XSS, CSRF, Command injections and so on. So I basically try to think in more advanced way to the ecosystem of web development and found that there are all these new frameworks which I have never heard of before and it seems like a lot of technologies like PHP have disappeared! There’s also all this hype around NoSQL and Serverless Functions.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things to learn but I decided to stick with this just for a while. I was recommended React and I thought it was a good idea because knowledge in React directly transferred over to React Native, so I could tackle web, and Android all at once.</p>

<p>After going through a lot of tutorials, I figured that the method that React forms Apps out of these Components is nice, and it felt like the object-oriented nature of Java applied to the JavaScript I was using before on my webpages.</p>

<p>I made a blog page (which ended up in the recycle bin because I didn’t like it that much) and that was about it. I didn’t do much since I was struggling for hours on CSS formatting and I had work to take care of. After that, I played around with React Native and didn’t make much either.</p>

<p>I ended up searching random frameworks (trying to get an idea of what they do) and I stumbled across Next.js. and it seemed nice, Vercel gave free SSL and it appeared really simple to make some simple backend stuff happen so I decided to make a website with Next.js.</p>

<p>I decided that Bootstrap would handle my CSS to make my site look better, so I installed it. Shortly after, I was warned by my friend not to use it and told me to switch to Tailwind instead. I still continue to use the icons that Bootstrap provide because they’re actually pretty nice.</p>

<p>To convince myself that I’ve understand a couple of things, I decided to make a wiki page which I did too much work but I did learn a lot. There was more complexity in the React components, and I also had to learn a bit of Firebase for databasing.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time doing that which made me feel annoyed, then I came back and thought of creating a blog so here I am now documenting my journey.</p>
