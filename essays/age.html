  <p>In these times it seems that any idiot with a laptop and wifi is able to create to a blog or a website and sell their miraculous recipes 2.0 to get out of the crisis, each more radical and more neocon, forgetting the deep diagnosis of the crisis, this it is, the great Iberian disease, the pandemic of institutionalized stupidity and nepotism.</p>

<p>From Darwin we know that we share a common origin with other species and that all species have to endure their daily doses of fears, sorrows and evils. However, humans have the misfortune of having to deal with the addition of pain caused by a group of people belonging to the human race. This group is much more powerful than the mafias, oil and pharmaceutical lobbies or international terrorist groups. It is not an organized group, governed by laws and bosses, but acts in perfect harmony as a universal and ubiquitous force. This is the group of fools, fools, and contact-ending idiots.</p>

<p>Some fools, like the traditional fools of the people, generate only limited damage but there are others that taken to positions of authority and power come to cause terrible damage to communities, businesses and entire societies. Family, political, financial, bureaucratic, media, and ecclesiastical classes and castes have been the ones that have allowed to this day a steady flow of stupid people to positions where the greatest damage is caused. Because fools can be fools but they are held in high esteem and know that favors in some parts of the world are offset by creating a virtual watch that covers res publica by selling reports without much foundation or vaporware.</p>

<p>I have no idea why the economy works or doesn’t work but I’m sure it won’t be because brilliant people are running it. If all the absurd economic and business decisions are added up, in 10% of cases the nonsense can come to compensate itself and even produce some reasonable results. The remaining 90% of business ventures fail before the age of ten. This fact proves that pseudo-economic science cannot predict, just as the precise moment of an earthquake cannot be predicted. However, illustrious silly graduates will continue to try to sell us policies based on trends and futurology.</p>

<p>Moreover, fools, in the epistemic arrogance of the manichment, maintain an economic, financial, educational and legislative circus so complex that no one is able to either unravel the generative stupidity or understand anything amid the noise of neologisms, acronyms and institutions that certify how good everything is. This explains why we spend much of the day rationalizing stupidities, trying to accept as logical what really is not, falsifying the image to adapt to the market , talking on newspeak without saying anything, hypnotized four hours a day in front of the TV … until there is no more smoke left to sell and the game of fools ends with payrolls down, unpaid mortgages and 20% unemployment.</p>
