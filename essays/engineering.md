"[Philippines] is not a good country for young graduates who want to work. It's not a country for those who want to learn. Unfortunately, you don't learn much here. The lifestyle is clearly lonely (...) work 6 days per week up to 14 hours a day. Liking is never liked at first (...) you learn to like."
