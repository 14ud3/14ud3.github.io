    "summary": "I am a Sotware Engineer and a Hardware Hacker currently majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I expect to graduate in Spring, 2024. While my work focuses on Security Research and Software Development, mostly solving problems on a broad range of systems, from low latency trading engine to grid computing or embedded systems, I love joining CP competitions, you can check my <a href='https://14ud3.blogspot.com'>old blog</a> here, I love building custom keyboards and playing chess. My non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing, philosophy to chaos theory. I could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!.",
